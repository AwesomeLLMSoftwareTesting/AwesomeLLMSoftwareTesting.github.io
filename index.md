# Awesome-LLM-SoftwareTesting

A collection of papers and resources about the utilization of large language models (LLMs) in software testing.

Software testing is a critical task that is essential for ensuring the quality and reliability of software products. As software systems become increasingly complex, new and more effective software testing techniques are needed. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a breakthrough technology in natural language processing and artificial intelligence. These models are capable of performing various coding-related tasks, including code generation and code recommendation. Therefore, the use of LLMs in software testing is expected to yield significant improvements. On one hand, software testing involves tasks such as unit test generation that require code understanding and generation. On the other hand, LLMs can generate diverse test inputs to ensure comprehensive coverage of the software being tested. In this repository, we present a comprehensive review of the utilization of LLMs in software testing. We have collected 102 relevant papers and conducted a thorough analysis from both software testing and LLMs perspectives, as summarized in Figure 1.

We hope this repository can help researchers and practitioners to get a better understanding of this emerging field. If this repository is helpful for you, please help us by citing this paper:

## OverviewðŸ”­
### From software testing perspective

We find that LLMs have proven to be efficient in the mid to late stages of the software testing lifecycle. During the mid-phase of software testing, LLMs have been successfully applied for various test case preparation tasks, including the generation of unit test cases, test oracle generation, and system test input generation. In later phases, such as the bug fix phase and the preparation of test reports/bug reports, LLMs have been utilized for tasks like bug analysis, debugging, and repair.

### From LLM perspective
In our collected studies, the LLM most frequently employed is ChatGPT, widely recognized and popular for its exceptional performance across various tasks. The second most commonly used LLM is Codex, trained on an extensive code corpus, aiding researchers in coding-related tasks. Ranked third is CodeT5, an open-source LLM capable of conducting pre-training and fine-tuning with domain-specific data, thereby achieving better performance.
